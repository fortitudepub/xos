A project which is built on top of OpenDaylight as an SDN application.

The project which was desired to manage 2 SDN switch in order to enable active-backup, however it failed because there is a lot of
issues during the time we build this application.

Now I make this project opensource to give a reference to those who are interested in OpenDaylight and SDN applications.

You may obtain the following samples from this project:

- MDSAL clustering interaction, though at the time when I develop the application it does have some issues which I have workarouded.
- MDSAL data store interaction
- OpenFlow interaction with SDN switch
