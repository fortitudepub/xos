    /* NOTE:
       We will add some asiainfo related variables here, it will be abbreviated to ai. 

       NOTE_ZDY:
       I suggest use ai- prefix for data tree node of list type as naming convention to solve the following
       problem:

       For example we have the following data definition:

       list tests {
       uses test;
       }

       YANG-TOOLS generated Tests class to abstract the list member, however, there is also a Test class which
       means the test type, this will cause confusing for us when we programming or reading other code.

       The list name is also suggested to does not keep the postfix 's', otherwise the generated list
       member class will also have the 's' postfix, which seems no reasonable as a singular.

       So the desired definition should be
       list ai-test {
       uses test;
       }

       TODO:
       We may support a simple LACP to form MLAG for the attached host between the intermediate L2SW
       link may not down even OFSW down.
